# Emerging-Systems-and-Architecture

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

The project was set up to combine a couple of things from throughout the course to test your knowledge and skills within it. You have to set up the device to be able to use the thermometer, buttons, and LEDs to generate a program.
The problem this project solved is setting up a "temperature limit" and telling the user via the LED whether or not the temperature was surpassing it.

## What did you do particularly well?

I think what I did particularly well was setting up the LEDs to respond. They are easier to manipulate and set to do different things.

## Where could you improve?

I definitely could imporove with the UART functionalities. They seem so fragile that its easy to screw them up.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I'm not sure there are new tools I will be adding, but a resource that has always been good for me whenever I need it is StackOverflow. They have a wealth of knowledge, advice, and tips that can help smooth over a myriad of issues you might have.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I think the ability to adjust with prompts and instructions even when they might not be 100% accurate is a good skill to have. You won't always been given the exact right thing to do so the ability to improvise can go a long ways.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

As always, I try to comment as much as I can in order to let people who are reading my code know what is going on. Of course this also helps me. Sometimes when you put code down and then pick it up a day later you forget what everything does and those comments help.
